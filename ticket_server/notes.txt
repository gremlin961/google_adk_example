ticket_id: 33343, contact_name: Richard, note: Troubleshooting plan to help install the black wire:

Step 1: Identify the label on the terminal where the black wire was connected on your previous thermostat.
Step 2: Refer to the wiring diagrams in the Nest Thermostat E installation guide (page 5) to determine the corresponding terminal on the Nest Thermostat E base for that label.
Step 3: Connect the black wire to the identified terminal on the Nest Thermostat E base according to the label it had on the old thermostat.
Step 4: Review the connected wires on the Nest base against the diagram for your system type to ensure correct installation.

**Step 1:** Re-verify your wiring against the diagrams in the installation guide, paying close attention to the Y1 terminal (for cooling/compressor) and the C terminal (common wire, if present). Ensure wires are fully inserted and secure.
**Step 2:** Confirm you have correctly configured the system type (Conventional, Heat Pump) and controlled functions (heating, cooling) within the thermostat settings (Settings > Equipment). Check the O/B wire setting if it's a heat pump.
**Step 3:** Check the circuit breaker or fuse box for the HVAC system and ensure the breaker controlling the air conditioner/furnace/heat pump is switched on.
**Step 4:** Run a system test via the thermostat interface (Settings > Equipment > Test > Cooling or Heat) to specifically test the compressor circuit. Observe if the compressor attempts to start or if any errors appear on the display.
**Step 5:** Wait at least 5 minutes after requesting cooling, thermostats have built-in delays to protect the compressor.
**Step 6:** If a C-wire is connected, confirm it is correctly connected at both the thermostat base and the HVAC system's control board. If no C-wire is present, inquire about any previous power-related issues or errors.
**Step 7:** Review the HVAC system's compatibility details with the guide to rule out fundamental incompatibility.
ticket_id: 3343433, contact_name: Richard, note: Troubleshooting plan:

Step 1: Has cooling worked previously with this thermostat?
Step 2: Is the thermostat set to Cool mode and is the target temperature lower than the current ambient temperature?
Step 3: Check the thermostat display for any error codes or messages (e.g., power-related errors, wire detection issues).
Step 4: There is a built-in compressor delay (up to 5 minutes). Please wait and observe if cooling starts.
Step 5: Check HVAC system power: verify circuit breakers are on and any HVAC power switches (often near the air handler/furnace) are enabled.
Step 6: If the system has a condensate drain pan, check if the pan is full and if a safety switch might be cutting power. Be cautious and get professional help if you are uncomfortable.
Step 7: Check the thermostat's wiring: ensure the Y1 wire (cooling) is securely seated in its connector. If a C wire is present, check its connection too. Verify power wires (Rh or Rc) are also secure.
Step 8: If the issue persists after checking wiring and power, contact a qualified HVAC technician or Nest Pro for further diagnosis of the HVAC system itself.
