Step 1: Confirm you've turned off power to your HVAC system at the breaker or switch before starting the installation.
Step 2: Verify you've properly removed your old thermostat and correctly identified and labeled the wires.
Step 3: Check the wiring connections at the Nest E base, ensuring they match the diagrams in the installation guide for your specific system type.
Step 4: Confirm the Nest E display is securely clicked into place on the base.
Step 5: Restore power to the HVAC system.
Step 6: Go through the initial setup process on the Nest E thermostat display or the Google Home app, checking for any errors during this process.
Step 7: If the thermostat does not power on or shows an error, troubleshoot based on the specific error message or lack of power (e.g., check for a C wire connection if needed, verify breaker is on).
